This is a program to understand different types of Algorithms that can be used to solve the Knapsack problem.

These files are in Python.
So, all you need to do is install python 3 on your computer with Windows or mac (It comes inbuilt on mac).

In your terminal window, access the directory where you are storing the files and type 'python main.py'

Play with the code, create your own branch, and I would love to see your contribution.
